# Number System

A number system is a way of representing and manipulating numbers. There are many different number systems,
including the commonly used decimal system, as well as binary, octal, and hexadecimal systems.
Each number system has a unique set of rules for representing numbers, which can be used for various
applications in mathematics, science, and computing.

## [Binary System][binary_number_what_is_wiki]

The binary system is a **base-2** numeral system that uses only two digits, **0** and **1**, to represent numbers.
Each digit in a binary number is called a bit, and its value is determined by its position within the number.
The rightmost bit has a value of $2^0$ (1), the next bit to the left has a value of $2^1$ (2), then $2^2$ (4), $2^3$ (8),
and so on. Binary numbers are used extensively in digital electronics and computer science.

## [Decimal System][decimal_number_what_is_wiki]

The decimal system is the most commonly used number system, also known as the **base-10** system.
It uses ten digits, from **0** to **9**, and each digit's value is determined by its position within the number.
The rightmost digit has a value of $10^0$ (1), the next digit to the left has a value of $10^1$ (10),
then $10^2$ (100), $10^3$ (1000), and so on. To convert a decimal number to its binary equivalent, the value of
each digit is multiplied by its weight and the results are summed.

## [Hexadecimal System][hexadecimal_number_what_is_wiki]

The hexadecimal system is a **base-16** numeral system that uses 16 digits, from **0** to **9** and **A** to **F**,
to represent numbers. Each digit's value is determined by its position within the number, with the rightmost digit
having a value of $16^0$ (1), the next digit to the left having a value of $16^1$ (16), then $16^2$ (256), $16^3$ (4096),
and so on. The hexadecimal system is commonly used in computing for representing memory addresses and other data.

## [Octal System][octal_number_what_is_wiki]

The octal system is a **base-8** numeral system that uses eight digits, from **0** to **7**, to represent numbers.
Each digit's value is determined by its position within the number, with the rightmost digit having a value of $8^0$ (1),
the next digit to the left having a value of $8^1$ (8), then $8^2$ (64), $8^3$ (512), and so on.

## Other Number Systems

There are many other number systems, including **base-3**, **base-4**, and **base-12** systems, which are used in various applications.
Each system has its unique set of rules for representing and manipulating numbers, and their applications can range
from mathematical calculations to computer programming.

## Conclusion

A number system is a way of representing and manipulating numbers, with different systems offering different advantages
for different applications. The most commonly used number system is the decimal system, but other systems,
such as **binary**, **octal**, and **hexadecimal**, are widely used in computing and digital electronics. Understanding number
systems is essential for various fields of study, including mathematics, science, and computer science.
