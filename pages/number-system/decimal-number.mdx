# Decimal Number

A decimal number, also known as a **base-10** number, is a number expressed in the decimal numeral system, which uses ten
digits: **0**, **1**, **2**, **3**, **4**, **5**, **6**, **7**, **8**, and **9**.

Each digit in a decimal number represents a value, which is determined by its position within the number.
The rightmost digit has a value of $10^0$ (1), the next digit to the left has a value of $10^1$ (10),
then $10^2$ (100), $10^3$ (1000), and so on. The value of each digit in a decimal
number is multiplied by its weight, and the results are summed to obtain the decimal value of the number.

## History

The decimal system has been used since ancient times, with evidence of its use dating back to ancient **Egypt** ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¬ and
**Babylonia** ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¶. However, the modern decimal system, which uses a positional notation and a zero digit, was developed
in **India** ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³ around the 6th century CE.

The system was later adopted by the Islamic world and **Europe** ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡º, and it eventually became the most widely used
numeral system in the world.

## Applications

The decimal system is the most commonly used numeral system in everyday life, and it is used in various applications, including:

- **Mathematics**: Decimal numbers are used extensively in arithmetic, algebra, and calculus, as well as in scientific and engineering calculations.
- **Finance**: Decimal numbers are used to represent currency values, stock prices, and other financial data.
- **Measurement**: Decimal numbers are used to represent units of measurement, such as length, weight, and volume.
- **Computer science**: Decimal numbers are used in computer programming, although [binary][binary_number_what_is_wiki] and [hexadecimal][hexadecimal_number_what_is_wiki] systems are more commonly used in digital electronics.

## Conversion

Decimal numbers can be converted to other numeral systems, such as [binary][binary_number_what_is_wiki],
[octal][octal_number_what_is_wiki], and [hexadecimal][hexadecimal_number_what_is_wiki], using various algorithms and methods.

For example, to convert a decimal number to binary, the number is repeatedly divided by 2, and the remainders are read
in reverse order to obtain the binary equivalent.

Similarly, to convert a decimal number to hexadecimal, the number is repeatedly divided by 16, and the remainders are read in reverse order, with values greater than 9 represented by letters A-F.

## Conclusion

The decimal system is a fundamental concept in mathematics, science, and everyday life, and it is used to represent and
manipulate numerical data in various applications. Understanding decimal numbers and their properties is essential for various
fields of study, and it is a crucial component of digital literacy in the modern world.
