  Octal number is a base-8 number system used in mathematics and computer programming, which uses eight digits: 
  0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7. Each digit in an octal number represents a value, which is determined by its position 
  within the number. The value of each digit in an octal number is multiplied by its weight, and the results are 
  summed to obtain the decimal value of the number.

# Octal Number

An octal number is a **base-8** number expressed in the octal numeral system, which uses eight digits: **0**, **1**, **2**,
**3**, **4**, **5**, **6**, and **7**. Each digit in an octal number represents a value, which is determined by its position
within the number. The rightmost digit has a value of $8^0$ (1), the next digit to the left has a value of $8^1$ (8),
then $8^2$ (64), $8^3$ (512), and so on. The value of each digit in an octal number is multiplied by its weight, and
the results are summed to obtain the decimal value of the number.

## Example

Let's take the octal number **345**, which has three digits.

- The rightmost digit is 5, which has a value of

  5 x $8^0$ = 5 x 1 = 5

- The next digit to the left is 4, which has a value of

  4 x $8^1$ = 4 x 8 = 32

- The leftmost digit is 3, which has a value of

  3 x $8^2$ = 3 x 64 = 192

To obtain the decimal equivalent of the octal number **345**, we add these values together:

`5 + 32 + 192 = 229`

Therefore, the decimal equivalent of the octal number **345** is **229**.

## History

The octal system was first introduced in the mid-19th century by mathematician
[James Joseph Sylvester][james_joseph_sylvester_wikipedia], who used it as ashorthand notation for binary numbers in
machine language.

The system was later adopted by computer scientists and programmers, who used octal notation as a
convenient way to represent groups of three binary digits.

## Applications

Octal numbers are used in computer programming and digital electronics as a convenient way to represent
[binary numbers][binary_number_what_is_wiki].

Each octal digit represents a group of three binary digits, and octal notation can be used to represent large
binary numbers in a compact and easy-to-read format.

Octal notation is also used in some programming languages, such as C and Unix shell scripts, to represent
file permissions and other system settings.

## Conversion

Octal numbers can be converted to other numeral systems, such as binary, decimal, and hexadecimal,
using various algorithms and methods.

For example, to convert an octal number to binary, each octal digit is replaced with its binary equivalent,
and the results are concatenated to obtain the binary equivalent.

Similarly, to convert an octal number to decimal, each octal digit is multiplied by its weight, and the results are
summed to obtain the decimal equivalent.

## Conclusion

Octal numbers are a fundamental concept in computer programming and digital electronics, and they are used to
represent binary numbers in a compact and convenient format. Understanding octal numbers and their properties is
essential for various fields of study, and it is a crucial component of digital literacy in the modern world.
