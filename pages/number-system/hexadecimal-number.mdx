  A hexadecimal number is a base-16 number system used in computer programming and other fields, which uses sixteen digits: 
  0-9 and A-F. Each digit represents a value determined by its position within the number, and can be converted to other numeral 
  systems using various algorithms. Hexadecimal numbers are widely used in computer memory addressing and cryptography.

# Hexadecimal Number

A hexadecimal number is a **base-16** number expressed in the hexadecimal numeral system, which uses sixteen digits:
**0**, **1**, **2**, **3**, **4**, **5**, **6**, **7**, **8**, **9**, **A**, **B**, **C**, **D**, **E**, and **F**.

Each digit in a hexadecimal number represents a value, which is determined by its position within the number.
The rightmost digit has a value of $16^0$ (1), the next digit to the left has a value of $16^1$ (16),
then $16^2$ (256), $16^3$ (4096), and so on.

The value of each digit in a hexadecimal number is multiplied by its weight, and the results are summed to obtain
the decimal value of the number.

## Example

Let's take the hexadecimal number **2F8**, which has three digits.

- The rightmost digit is 8, which has a value of

  8 x $16^0$ = 8 x 1 = 8

- The next digit to the left is F, which has a value of

  15 x $16^1$ = 15 x 16 = 240

- The leftmost digit is 2, which has a value of

  2 x $16^2$ = 2 x 256 = 512.

To obtain the decimal value of the number `2F8`, we add these values together:

`8 + 240 + 512 = 760`

## History

The hexadecimal system was introduced in the mid-20th century as a convenient way to represent
[binary numbers][binary_number_what_is_wiki].

Since each hexadecimal digit represents four binary digits, it was easier to read and write large binary numbers in
hexadecimal form.

The system was widely adopted in computer programming, where it is used to represent `memory addresses`, `register values`,
and other data types.

## Applications

Hexadecimal numbers are used in various fields such as computer programming, mathematics, and electronics.

They are commonly used in computer memory addressing, as well as in the representation of color values in digital images.

In addition, hexadecimal numbers are used in `cryptography` to represent encryption keys and other sensitive data.

## Conversion

Hexadecimal numbers can be converted to other numeral systems, such as binary, octal, and decimal,
using various algorithms and methods.

For example, to convert a hexadecimal number to binary, each hexadecimal digit is replaced by its four-bit binary equivalent.

Similarly, to convert a hexadecimal number to decimal, each digit is multiplied by its weight and the results are summed.

## Conclusion

Hexadecimal numbers are a fundamental concept in computer programming and various other fields, and they are used to
represent memory addresses, register values, and other data types. Understanding hexadecimal numbers and their
properties is essential for computer science and programming, and it is a crucial component of numeracy in the modern world.
